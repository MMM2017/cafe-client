# SmartCafe Client

Frontend part for coursach: an Android client for SmartCafe.

## What Tools Do I Need?

- JDK
- Android SDK:
	- Build Tools of version exactly 23.0.2;
	- SDKs for API level 15;
	- SDKs for the highest available API level *(optional)*;
	- AppCompat lib;
- Android Studio as IDE

## Please Be Careful to:

- **do not commit** (at least to master) if your **build fails**! Fix the buildfile and only then make a commit;
- **do not change the build file** (`build.gradle`) until you are completely sure that:
	- you understand all the consequences it will make;
	- you absolutely clear understand what you're doing;
	- no one will suffer unfairly from this changes;
	- nothing critical will be broken, if you are doing your changes in master (shame on you).

Android build system is very sensitive to Moon phases and star and planet positions, and as fragile as your grandma's crystal tea set. Please, deal with it carefully.
